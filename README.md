edn-tests
=========

common set of valid edn tests intended to be used by anyone implementing an edn library. 

Ideally there will be large files for testing performance across various platforms. 

If you would like to fork it and add your platform under platforms with the expected equivalent readable forms for your platform that would be awesome. 

e.g.

/valid-edn/vector.edn "[1 2 3]"
/platforms/js/vector.js "[1, 2, 3]"
